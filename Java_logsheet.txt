Collections:
The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces(list,queue)and classes(ArrayList,HashSet,HashMap)
List: Alternates of array but its size is not fixed.
The list() method of java.util.Collections class is used to return an array list containing the elements returned by the specified enumeration in the order they are returned by the enumeration. 
Set: Same as list but it has unique elements and it does not store duplicates elements.

Map: It follows key value pair.It has 2 components.
1.Key (unique)
2.Value

Lists,Set and Map are Interfaces.

Size - It is used to get the number of elements in this list.

Get - The get() method of ArrayList in Java is used to get the element of a specified index within the list.

Add - Element can be added in Java ArrayList using add() method of java.util.ArrayList class.

Throw : The throw keyword in Java is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code. We can throw either checked or unchecked Exceptions. The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exceptions. 

Syntax: throw new ArithmeticException("/ by zero");

Throws: throws is a keyword in Java that is used in the signature of a method to indicate that this method might throw one of the listed type exceptions. The caller to these methods has to handle the exception using a try-catch block. Hierarchical Exception.

Syntax: type method_name(parameters) throws exception_list



6/2/2024(Tuesday)
Finally:
The finally keyword is used to execute code (used with exceptions - try..catch statements) no matter if there is an exception or not.
Java finally block is always executed whether an exception is handled or not. Therefore, it contains all the necessary statements that need to be printed regardless of whether the exception occurs or not.


Contains: The contains() method checks whether a string contains a sequence of characters.Returns true if the characters exist and false if not. 5/2/2024(Monday)
Exception Handling:
When executing Java code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, or other unforeseeable things.When an error occurs, Java will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: Java will throw an exception (throw an error).
For all exceptions in java parent is the  exception and for exception there is a parent called throwable.
Try:The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed. It contains a set of statements when an exception can occur.
Catch: The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block. It is always used to handle the uncertain conditions of a try block.We can have multiple catch blocks. Every catch block must have a different exception. Parent exceptions should be written at the end.

Converting primitive data into object:



2/2/2024(Friday)

Wrapper class:

Wrapper class is a class which is used to convert the primitive values into an object and an object into a  primitive

 This Keyword:

This keyword is a reference variable which refers to the current object
The this() constructor call should be used to reuse the constructor from the constructor. it maintains the chain link between the constructor.
The this() keyword is used between the inside of class and outside of the method.

1/2/2024(Thursday)
Immutable : Once it is created it cannot be changed. 
Rule 1: To make objects immutable make all the methods private including setter methods.

Static Keyword: The static keyword in java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply static keyword with variable, methods, blocks and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

Static Members: Static members maintains separate memory block.
Rule1: If there is a static member by making public you can access using classname. 
Rule2: I there is non static member you cannot access with static member.







Scanner: The Scanner class is used to get user input, and it is found in the java.util package.
To use the Scanner  class, create an object of the class and use any of the available methods found in the Scanner  class documentation. In our example, we will use the nextLine() method, which is used to read Strings.
The Java Scanner class is widely used to parse text for strings and primitive types using a regular expression. It is the simplest way to get input in Java. By the help of Scanner in Java, we can get input from the user in primitive types such as int, long, double, byte, float, short, etc.
String Pool : String pool is nothing but a storage area in Java heap where string literals stores. It is also known as String Intern Pool or String Constant Pool. It is just like object allocation. By default, it is empty and privately maintained by the Java String class. Whenever we create a string the string object occupies some space in the heap memory. Creating a number of strings may increase the cost and memory too which may reduce the performance also.31/1/2024(Wednesday)

Final Keyword: Final keyword is Java just acts like a constant.The final keyword is non-access modifier used for classes,attributes and methods which make them impossible to inherit or override.
1.Java Final Variable
If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of the final variable(It will be constant).
2.Java Final Method
If you make any method final, you cannot override it.
3.Java Final Class
If you make any class as final, you cannot extend it.

Encapsulation:Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit. We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.
It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.
Java Bean: It is an object. All the data members are private. To access private members there must be getter and setter methods. Every Java Bean is encapsulated.





28/1/2024(Sunday)
Runtime Polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch: It is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime(JRE) rather than compile-time.
In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass. The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.

Access Specifiers in Java:



26/1/2024(Friday)

Abstraction: Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

Abstract Class in Java: A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java . It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).
 
Syntax:  abstract void printStatus();
Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects to access it, it must be inherited from another class.
Abstract Interface in Java: Interfaces have unimplemented methods. In interface by default it is abstract.Interface can have only abstract methods. Interface cant provide the implementation of abstract class.





25/1/2024(Thursday)

Is a Relation: It implies that a subclass is a specific type of its superclass. For example, consider a class hierarchy with a superclass called "Animal" and a subclass called "Dog." We can say that a Dog is an Animal, which reflects the is-a relationship.

Syntax: class SubclassName extends SuperclassName{

}

Instance Of Operator:The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).
The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type. It returns either true or false. If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, it returns false.
EX:  class Simple1{  
public static void  main(String args[]){  
 Simple1 s= new Simple1();  
 System.out.println(s instanceof Simple1);//true  
 }  
}  


Super Keyword: The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly which is referred by super reference variable.We can use super keyword to access the data member or field of parent class. It is used if parent class and child class have the same fields.

Polymorphism: The ability to take more than one form.
Types of polymorphism:
1.compile-time polymorphism
2.Runtime polymorphism

Method overloading:
When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded.

Ex: void area(int x){
}
void area(int l,int b){
}

Method overriding:
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class.same signature in a child class is  over riding.

Signature: 
1.No of parameters and types of parameters are same
2.return type

Typecasting:It allows to  convert variables from one data type to another data type.
1.Widening Typecasting:
Converting a lower data type into a higher one is called widening type casting. It is also known as implicit conversion or casting down. It is done automatically. It is safe because there is no chance to lose data. It takes place when:
Both data types must be compatible with each other.
The target type must be larger than the source type.
Ex: int ans = (22/7) * 12 *12
Narrowing Typecasting:
Converting a higher data type into a lower one is called narrowing type casting. It is also known as explicit conversion or casting up. It is done manually by the programmer. If we do not perform casting then the compiler reports a compile-time error.
Ex: Float k =  34.6
ans = (int)k
Upcasting: Low level to high level
Downcasting: High level to low level

Rules of Interface:
Class extends class
Class implements interface 1,2,3..
Class extends class & implements interface 1,2,3..
Interface extends interface(i.e class cannot be a parent for interface).

Short cut for multiline comments in Eclipse is ctrl + shift + /.A
One  interface can have multiple parent interface:
 Java Class can only extend one parent class. Multiple inheritance is not allowed. Interfaces are not classes, however, and an interface can extend more than one parent interface.
The extends keyword is used once, and the parent interfaces are declared in a comma-separated list.
EX:  public interface Hockey extends Sports, Event.


19/1/2024(Friday)
Inheritance: 
Inheritance acquires the properties from parent class to child class
Types Of Inheritance:
Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, Child class inherits the properties of parent class.
In java we can inherit using extends keyword.
Multilevel Inheritance: In Multilevel Inheritance, a child class will be inheriting a parent class, and as well as the child class also acts as the parent class for other classes.
Hierarchical Inheritance: In Hierarchical Inheritance, one class serves as a parent class for more than one child class.
Multiple Inheritance:  one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes. 
Hybrid Inheritance: It is a mix of two or more above types of  inheritance.

Interface: 1.It’s like a class.
2. You cannot create object for interface.
3.Use interface keyword  to create.
4.In interface every method must be unimplemented.
5.Using implements keyword we can have one or more than one interface.



18/1/2024(Thursday)
Note:
1.Static members must be called inside static member.
2.Inside non static method you can call static and non-static methods
3.Inside static method you can call static and methods.

Loops:
Loops are used in programming to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is met.
For loop:

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {

}
While loop:
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

If loop:
Use the if statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is true.

if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

If else loop:
Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

Wrapper class in java:

Wrapper classes also provide a way to handle Exceptions in Java. For example, the Integer wrapper class provides the parseInt() method, which is used to parse an int from a String. If the specified String does not contain a valid integer value, the process will throw a NumberFormatException.

Ex:Integer number = Integer.parseInt("123");

char-0
int-0
boolean-false
double-0
long-0

1.Object default value is null.

Initalizing an object using new keyword followed by constructor:
New is a keyword that is used to create a new object of a class. The syntax is new MethodName(). It creates a new object of the specified class and calls a constructor.

Class structure 
class Classname { 
             //class members 
             1.Data members 
              2. Behavioural members
   }
Data members we have to specify datatype before variable.
Data members are of 2 types: 
1.primitive Data Types: primitive data types stores a single value. Primitive data types are int,float,char,double,long,short,boolean
2.Derived Data Types:Derived data types is derived from the primitive data types.
Derived Data types are arrays,object,string.

Object: object is a real time entity.object name should be a real world specified name.
Syntax: class_definition_name obj_name;
Ex: car kiaseltosGT;

Bank account type : Bank account type holds int.
Bank account transaction type: Deposit- float,withdraw-float.interest -float.
